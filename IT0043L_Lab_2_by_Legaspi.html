    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) no. 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.</i></p>
    <p><b><u>Background of SDG:</u></b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid economic growth and increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger. Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There are 821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of Africa, as well as in South America. Considering the factors mentioned, the goal of SDG no. 2 (Zero Hunger) is to combat all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people especially children have sufficient and nutritious food all year. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Overall Importance:</b> Basically, hunger and malnutrition are major barriers to development and achieving Zero Hunger helps improve health, education, and economic stability, while supporting a sustainable environment.</p>
